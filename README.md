# Workarounds for i2p SOCKS proxy and Socket-based applications on Anonymity Distributions

This sets up forwarding from a workstation to a Whonix-like VM containing an
i2p router. For better or for worse, it's based on the
whonix/anon-ws-disable-stacked-tor approach and shares a bunch of code with it.
A more generic way of generating the systemd files would probably be better.

Please do not misattribute this project to any anonymity distribution. It's very
new and I'm not at all sure it's a good idea. New to this whole business. I
don't have Qubes on my laptop(I am a poor person.), this is the easiest way to
get it to my desktop when I'm not at home.

## It is **not** tested. More just, used once or twice. Don't use it yet unless you're trying to develop it.

I am pretty sure it might work now.
